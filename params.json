My interests span from machine learning and data science, to economics and history.  I’m a huge statistics nerd. I also happen to love biking, sailing, and baseball (go Mariners).\r\n\r\nMost recently I worked as a data science intern at Bitly.  There I worked to bring more meaning and understanding to bitly data, for both the company and it's users, through projects like the [Read-Time Media Map](http://luvit.me/1fLMtq3).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
