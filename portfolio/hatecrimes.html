                    <h3>Intro</h3>
                    <p>This map shows the distribution of hate crimes across the US from 2005 to 2012.  Data is derived from FBI hate crime statistics published each year, and US census data.  The map is rendered using D3.js using the Albers projection.   Coloring is based off the distance the state's per capita crime rate is from that year's mean.  State crime rates are normalized based off state population and the percentage of the state covered by the reported data.</p>

                    <h3>Data Aggregation</h3>
                    <p>Data is aggregated from two main sourced. FBI data is gathered from annual Uniform Crime Reports found <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime" target="_blank">here</a>.  Reports come from each years Location Types statistics, Table 12, Agency Hate Crime Reporting.  These reports don't necessarily represent all hate crimes occurring across the nation as agency participation in reporting is voluntary.</p>

                    <p>Census data is used to estimate the population of each state.  Populations are for the most part estimated since the census is only conducted periodically.  The number of crimes committed divided by the population gives the per capita crime rate.  Population estimates are downloaded from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Building the Map</h3>
                    <p>D3.js was used for data visualization.  D3 is a Javascript library allowing for manipulating documents based on data.  Map rendering uses TopoJSON, an extension of GeoJSON.  TopoJSON allows for massively reduced map file sizes, usually up to 85% smaller than GeoJSON files.  State names in the map file are used to id line segments that correspond with state boarders.  These ids are then later referenced to color states by their crime distribution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hate Crime Distribution</h3>
                    <p>Colors on the map are based off a linear scale.  This scale gives darker colors (blue and red) to per capita crimes rates several standard deviations from the mean.  The mean is based on the average per capita crime rate for any given year.  Statistically speaking most states should fall within one standard deviation from the mean.  Those states with crime rate several deviations above or below the mean are most likely to be experiencing some form of anomalous behavior, whether in reporting or crimes themselves.</p> 

                    <p>States shaded in red have crime rates falling below the national average.  The current hypothesis for states falling significantly below the average is that they either, have very poor reporting due to bias on the part of law enforcement, or do not have thorough legislation in place to protect minority groups.  States where discrimination is prevalent could very well have law enforcement offers equally as discriminatory as perpetrators of the crimes. For this reason, victims could either not be reporting attacks, knowing nothing will be done, or filing reports that are later swept under the rug by corrupt law enforcement.  States with weak definition of hate crimes, or who have not extended legislation to cover certain minority groups, could experience lower reporting due to lack of guidance on how to treat such cases.</p>

                    <p>States shaded in blue have crime rates falling above the national average.  Some of this could be due to rate inflation discussed in the next section.  It can be hypothesized however that states that actually experience crime rates far above the national average do so for several reason.  The biggest of these bing that some states, despite having high levels of intolerance and prejudice, have strict hate crime legislation and clear guidelines on how and when to report acts as such.  Another reason that may prove to be particularly important in recent and coming years data, is the granting of protected status to minorities under new federal and state legislation.  The expansion of such protections, especially in the years immediately following legislative changes, could drastically increase state crime rates, due to those crimes, while having occurred in previous years, now falling under hate crime statute.</p>

                    <p>The implementation of these distributions are covered in the <b>Anomaly Detection</b> section.  Discussion of trends with regard to legislation will be covered later when <b>Legislation Analysis</b> has been implemented with the map.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Map Bias</h3>
                    <p>Crime rates are bias toward low population states and states with high population coverage.  Some state have a very low number of participating agencies, artificially lowering the crime rate due to a large number of crimes going unreported.  Low population states cause singular crimes to have a greater impact on the crime rate.  Those states with small populations that have high tourism industries are effected even more, crimes against, or by, non-residents are accounted as crime within the state.  Such effected states include states such as D.C. and Hawaii.</p> 

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Accounting for Population Coverage</b></li>
                        <p>Crime data is only provided by certain participating agencies in each state.  These agencies do not necessarily cover the entire population of that state.  We therefore need to estimate the number of hate crimes based on the recorded number and the population covered by reporting agencies.</p>
                        <p>To get an estimate of the number of hate crime actually committed in each state I used the Rule of Large Numbers.  By diving number of reported crimes by the percentage of the population covered we get a number that estimates the actual number of hate crimes.  The estimated number of crimes is what was used to derive the number of hate crimes committed per capita.</p>

                        <p>Estimating the number of hate crimes in this way creates a source for error in the data.  States with low reporting have a lower level precision versus states with high reporting.  This low precision data could be either over estimated or underestimated vastly.  Over estimations could occur if reporting agencies are generally located in urban areas or areas with higher crime rates.  Under estimation could occur in regions with stigma against reporting, this would lead numbers reported to be lower than realistically occur.</p>

                        <li><b>Anomaly Detection</b></li>
                        <p></p>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Future Development</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Legislation Analysis</b></li>
                        <p>Currently this map is just a basic analysis of known hate crimes across the US.  Development is being done to compare trends against legislation passed regarding hate crime.  The final goal is to determine what type of legislation and enforcement effect hate crimes the most.  A further objective is to determine which states need to improve their legislation or enforcement procedures the most.</p>
